## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jose Emanuel Nieva Toppa and I live in TucumÃ¡n, Argentina.

### I'm a front-end oriented fullstack web programmer, indie video game developer and advanced architecture student. Due to my training and what I do, I discovered that my profile is creative.

I am interested in constantly challenging myself and learning new things, thanks to this I learned about many programs that help me solve problems of different types and learn about other possible solutions in a more creative way.
This is why I would describe myself as an observant and enthusiastic person who likes to learn while having fun.

I really enjoy the places where you work as a team, share ideas and challenges, and where I can help other people.

Iâ€™m currently studying ***Certified Tech Dev carrear dictated by Digital House, organized by Globant and Mercado Libre*** and doing some courses related to **React.js and Three.js**

In my free time i work on a **Harry Potter** game remake running in **Unreal Engine.**

I will love to know something about you and the problems we can solve together!
**Contact me via e-mail at jose.ent@hotmail.com or linkedin and lets have a nice talk**
